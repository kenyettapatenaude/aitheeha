The VyOS team has stopped providing free downloads of the current release, but you can build them directly from their github repository. I ran into a number of issues while attempting to setup a proper Debian 8 build environment for the VyOS 1.2.x crux branch, so I thought I would share my build process. This was done in a VMware environment with vCenter, but should be easily adapted to any hypervisor.

SOLVED: I wasn't using a router, was getting lucky with IP addresses. Starting about a week ago, both of the desktops I have upstairs started throwing an "unidentified network-no internet" error on the ethernet connections. Both are running Win10, both using the integrated ethernet jack on motherboards. The cabling runs through the walls, is CAT-6, and goes to a switch adjacent to the cable modem. Here's where it gets weird. My laptop, which also runs Win10, connects just fine to either ether. I have been lagging lately. Its driving me nuts. I recently upgraded my graphics card, then in turn needed to upgrade my power supply, and I am still lagging quite a bit. Here is my computer info if anyone can help.

Laptop model: Asus GL502VS As in the title, my touchpad doesn't work on freshly installed Gentoo. I tried with Debian (live CD) and it works. It also works on UEFI boot menu. I tried to activate different kernel options (like PS/2 mouse support, asus extras, HID support etc.), booting kernel with different options (i8042.nopnp etc.), adding xorg config for libinput devices. All these things didn't help ('Internal Pointing Device' in UEFI boot menu is enabled).

So, I've gotten past DDR stress test and calibration, boot loader (u-boot), i've got a working parallel 24-bit LCD (actually going through ser-des via LVDS because I need to capacitively couple through HV barrier); so everything is going great, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why the kernel is hanging. It was hanging on crypto caam so i disabled everthing with crypto caam in imx\_v7\_defconfig but now it's hanging on this dns thing. I think I need to somehow disable the hardwired.

Using NXP's i.mx6ul processor, custom board based on the eval board. I'm stuck at the kernel message "Key type dns\_resolver registered". My SD card appears to be fine, bootloader is fine, I have an image on my LCD, there are no obvious error messages in my boot log (see attached). I've used multiple file systems -- a minimal build with busybox, a version from buildroot, my own rootfs built with linaro, the demo version that comes with the eval board -- none of that helps.

One option for doing this is specifying environment variables and their values in the Dockerfile using the ENV statement, so that configuration data is built-in to images: Dockerfile . ENV MYSQL_USER=my_db_user . Your app can then parse these values from its running environment and configure its settings appropriately.

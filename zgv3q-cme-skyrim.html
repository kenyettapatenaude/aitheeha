                            <p>This one's a long shot, looks like it was taken down awhile ago but I only just found out about it. Nexus forum link (https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3128495-ohmy-cme-slots/) to old comments section in case it helps jog anyone's memory. So to go from the start. I bought sse and I thought it would be fun to play with some mods. I downloaded a few and they all work but then I downloaded ece, downloaded skse64, created a new game, made my character saved it into a save load, but then i did not find the cme save files in my skyrim files. I googled what i could do. Again I created a new game made a new carachter saved it into a save file, but the cem save file still werent there. Then I reinstalled ece, installed it using I get this when I start https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83718 (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83718) 20 CME is a presest compilation that I see people are using and im looking to find a mirror to it as the developer has made it hidden on Nexus mods, Would anyone I've been trying to use Enhanced Character Edit to load up some presets that I liked the look of, but. When I kick on the game the presets just do NOT appear. I've looked up this issue and checked: C:\Users\MyName\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\CME_Save (I even created this folder myself and dumped the files here manually) F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\SKSE\Plugins\CharGen\Presets (Dumped the files here manually as well) Neither I've come to a simple conclusion. I'm really fucking lonely. I've been single longer than I'd like to admit- and I'm sick of it. I don't want it any more. I want to share stuff with someone. I want to share life with someone. I want a girl, a woman, a whatever, who I can fucking lavish love upon. I want someone I can kiss and hold and make laugh with terrible jokes and ridiculous stories and my stupid fake Irish accent I slip into whenever I'm really pissed off because it makes me laugh 
hello, So I've been an NMM user for my whole life not until a few days ago when I decided to move to MO. That being said, I wanted to import some of the presets into the game but struggled to do so as the files are not one entity like what NMM does, and so the CME_saves that's supposed to be in the mygames/Skyrim does not exist. I tried researching around but couldn't find any useful clues. Please help me out Modding community, I am in need of your expertise. Just something i haven't seen asked at all, i don't know much about seventys sci-fi books, and i haven't heard anything about the stars in NMS spitting out CME's or solar flares, but yeah doe's anyone think we could see aurora's in the game? Although i haven't yet witnessed the aurora borealis with my own eyes, i've seen pictures and videos of it and i'll never forget the first time i saw one in skyrim (I literally just stopped dead and watched the sky for 10 minutes). I would Title. I only realized that this mod ( had created a duplicate high elf race after I tried entering showracemenu. This is less threatening as it is immediately visible (and seems self-contained, at the very least) but what entries should I look out for/how do I compare them in TESVedit to assess whether or not a mod makes changes to existing races? I am especially worried because this happened in the past- namely, this mod (http://www.nexusmods.c. 
Call me crazy but i used it and it worked.but before FPV id zoom in all the way(again before FPV) and had a dot on my screen of where my projectiles would be shooting, a makeshift crosshair if you will, that i used against stealthed targets or whatever i wanted to just by aiming that dot at the spot i wanted to shoot. for instance thieves and shadow refuge, id aim dead center of the SR and as soon as i saw them pop it id scorpion wire them out by AIMING my crosshair and yank their I was wondering if any of you could create a cme_save (or find one) for this (potentially nsfw) Oneechanbara ( or this ( I am absolutely terrible at character creation, as my characters never turn out right when basing them off of a model. I am using ECE and a few other mods (apachii hair, eyes of beauty, unpb, dimonized, etc, all from these (potentially nsfw) two ( pages. My slot load feature for ECE (CME) isn't working. I've tried so many things to fix it, but it just doesn't seem to be helping. I made the "CME_save" folder, and I put the custom CME save file in there. I go into Skyrim via SKSE client, and do "showracemenu" in console. Nothing, no "Slot Load" slider, none of the options in the "Presets" tab work, and I've even tried putting the bloody file in other folders with no luck. I'm at my wits end here, I just wanna play around with this feature! Please. Is there any way get additional thigh/body sliders for racemenu? I have been using using CME More Body Sliders for a long time now, it has sliders for thigh thickness, thigh gap, upper body scale/height and so on. I thought of switching to Racemenu because it seems to be better supported by XPMSE 3.49, but it lacks the aforementioned features (vanilla racemenu only has thigh scale, on L and R thight independently). I looked for a sliders addon mod and found this http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/. I don't understand. It was working six hours ago. Needless to say, SKSE and SKYUI are installed. I ran into SkyUI fatal error 4, so I reset the relevant three lines of settings for Skyrim.ini as the SkyUI FAQ advised. This did not fix the error, it showed up again. I then tried to uninstall better vampires. Suddenly, my MCM menu is gone, my install mods cannot be found in the console (even though the mesh/model files are still in the data folder, and all of my ESPs are checked), ECE stopped. 
So I've been grabbing a few save files and put them in the right folder, however when I go through racemenu and select the slot, it either tells me there is nothing there, or, it loads some jacked up looking person. I've pulled mods out, put mods in, I'm running out of ideas. Is there any way to open the save files in an editor to see if they look right before I try to load them in Skyrim? I've never gotten the cme save thing to work consistently, I've had maybe 2 slots load of about 15 tried. Where do I put other peoples ECE presets so I can load them up in-game? Apparently I should have a Documents\My Games\Skyrim\CME_save folder but I didn't so I created one and put my presets in there but when I try to load the presets up in-game I got an error. A second problem I've come across is that when I open up showracemenu and try to pick a race I get a faceMorph error of some sort. If you have any question please Hey Guys, I currently try to creat a good looking half-elf female using ECE ( ) But most facemods doesnt seem to work with ECE causing problems with CME's morphs (Error says check CME log file) So which mods can you recommend me for a pretty face using ECE (no hair mods) and how can i get a more white/pale skin with ece? Edit: can my skin get more pale/white by changeing The ECE presets work with Enhanced Character Edit. There is a CME folder in DocumentsgtSkyrim that the file goes into. I've been having trouble getting a character to look young. I have found mods but they seem too young. If anyone has a good one laying around I would be appreciative. File credits.

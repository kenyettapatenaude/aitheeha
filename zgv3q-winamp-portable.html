I am a portable app lunatic. I LOVE the idea of sandboxing all of my settings in a folder without touching anywhere else on the system. If I decide to remove the app, just delete the folder.

I just purchased a new laptop and I wanna keep it running like new for as long as possible.

Описание: Универсальный сборник программ, распределённых по категориям, с автоматической установкой на операционные системы Windows. Hello all. As the title suggests, I'm looking for a free music player app that supports .pla playlists. I manage my portable music library using my computer and out of the three programs that I use on my PC (MusicBee, Media Monkey, and Winamp), I find that Winamp is by far the most intuitive. It allows me to simply drag-and-drop individual songs from my PC's library into my portable library (as opposed to syncing or filling, which I don't like). Additionally, Winamp allows me to create

Messing around with things a bit on different software I have found some features that have been lacking in all so far and haven't been able to hunt down anything that is able to do the things I'm looking for. If you know of any software that is able to do what I list below, whether that is by default or with add-ons or extensions, please let me know (as well as let me know what the add-ons/ex.

Hi all, I'm on the hunt for a new software (Windows) that will allow me to play sound drops and audio files during my show. I play live audio snippets during my show and the software I currently use is no longer being updated and is starting to show its age. I'd like the following features: 1. Load at least 10 audio files on a single screen. 2. Independent volume control and transport buttons. 3. The ability to save a soundboard and its associated audio files (portable save) 4. Compact inter. Are there %-parameters for "item number" and the "now playing" indicator? I don't want seperate columns for this. I only want one column with item number, playing indicator, artist/album/track/title and one column with the duration. Because sometimes when I'm drunk I hit the column header, sort everything by name (hence fuck up the playlist), am too drunk to realize, close foobar and my playlist is gone -.- Or do you know any other way to prevent me from accidentally reordering the playlist. I am reinstalling my desktop to duel boot and get rid of all excess crap on it and was making a list (with download links) for everything I should install afterwards. This is the Windows download list that I have so far and was wondering if there is anything I'm missing or any better software that can replace something in the list? Note, if something is in an a,b,c. list, it's a 'choose one from here' type list. If it's just there, I plan on getting it. 1. Security i. (a) Avast. #Welcome to the AutoHotkey Subreddit! Hopefully, you're here with questions on how to learn this fantastic scripting language. There are plenty of knowledgeable folks here that can help you out. Update 2016-10-01 I took an opportunity to do a bunch of updating. I've expanded the text editor section to include multiple options, as well as another GUI creator and multiple other addons/plugins. I also pre-packed Notepad++ and Sublime to be compatible with AHK. I've also added a section. > What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. Gaming on all levels (Battlefield 4, Diablo 2, FATE, Steam games on all levels, MMORPG games, maybe Runescape, Minecraft with shaderpacks, etc.). Chrome/Firefox/Torch - Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, other surface websites. Spotify/Winamp. Digital art (not sure what programs yet. Havent really gotten a solid idea). CAD (Primarily Solidworks and Inventor). I not talking about "I prefer big bass" or something. I mean it sounds like a tinny alarm clock radio, absolutely unlistenable. The key seems to be turning down frequencies around 512-1k down about 10db. Without that, it always sounds horrendous. Everything I've read implies that this should NOT be the case with reasonable equipment. Again, I'm not talking about minor preference differences (IMHO), but objectively terrible sound with no depth. What am I doing wrong or misunderstanding? Equip. 
Foobar2000 is an extremely customizable and lightweight media player. You can customize it in any way you want. It can be far more powerful than iTunes, Winamp and MediaMonkey if you know how to use it. The problem is that it is fucking difficult to learn how to use. The learning curve is pretty much like a brick wall. This thread will hopefully introduce you to many of the basics. They best way to explain foobar's possibilities is with a demonstration of my own foobar set up. Take a look:. I'm about at my wits end with this issue and I don't know where to look for a fix. Basically my Galaxy S6 Edge+ (SM-G928V) will mount to my PC and I won't be able to access the files. I open the phone's drive and I usually get several unlabeled hard-drive thumbnails along with a few 0b blank files (File type: File). In addition if I try to manually copy a file to the phone while it is in this condition I get the error dialog "The device has either stopped responding or has been disconnected.". I've been using Senn HD238s for about 4 years, they were my introduction to a world of sound beyond ear buds and off brand headphones. I loved having them so much that I would use Winamp with the equalizer tuned to the Senn and a Sony Walkman mp3 player for it's customer equalizer. A love affair with music for the first time. Finally got a chance to upgrade after absorbing info on head fi for years, a 25% off deal on Grados SR80i, a nuforce portable amp and some Lcush head pieces. Been waitin. I used to use Audiogalaxy for my large audio collection. It allowed me to make pretty nifty playlists which I now have as m3u files. Now I've got a portable HDD and Audiogalaxy has long gone the way of the dodo (thanks Dropbox). There are certain m3u files that simply will not open in Windows Media Player, but will work in Winamp. I've re-pathed the audio files, so that's not the issue. My problem with Winamp is that it's "manage playlists" "feature" is a joke. It has made duplicates. 
I have had winamp since waaaaaaaaay back in the day when it first came out. back then. it really did kick the llama's ass. But now it seems to be slow.plagued with crashes. and. well. no longer llama ass kicking. I've been using VLC portable quite a bit. but im still kind of looking for a replacement for my main media playing. So what do you guys use? And what do you find to be the best music player for your system. So I've been using Resolume for some time now with some clips and a visualizer, I love it and I think I'm ready to buy another computer specifically made for VJing. I'm no beginner at building my own rig, but I've not been doing that for a while now, plus I have all these questions that I should probably worry about before I buy one. Here's my current situation and I hope you guys can help me on this one I want the rig to be as portable as possible, but I need to have multi-screen support. So I'm looking to get a new amp to use in conjunction with my E17 (with L7 line-out cable if necessary). Not looking to change DAC as I need coaxial input, and I'm not aware of anything else that's cheap, decent and has that. Currently I'm just using the E17 directly and it's not working as well as it could be. On +6 gain and half digital volume, some clipping/distortion is audible (especially on congested stuff like Skrillex). On +0 gain everything blends together to the point of being boring. Two issues on an otherwise awesome phone: 1. I'm not sure how other people put music on their phones, but I connect to my laptop with the cord that came with the Nexus 4. Win7 shows it as a portable device. When I drop mp3 files from my pc into the Music folder on my phone, I get an error on my pc saying something like, 'Error, are you sure you want to add this file, it may not play or be recognized'. I select 'yes, to all files' and it adds them with no problem. This error pops up every Hi askreddit readers. I am about to make my first post-college computer purchase, as my powerbook from 2004 is slow and somewhat useless. Here are my specifications: - Definitely want something portable. - Small and light, if possible (I think a 12" screen would be perfect for my purposes) - Battery life is not particularly important to me, but it would be nice if I were able to use my computer for 4-5 hours without it giving out on me. - Needs to be able to support the following A leaked version of Winamp 5.8 recently spread over the Internet.
